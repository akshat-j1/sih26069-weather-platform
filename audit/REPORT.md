| B6 | PASS | Perfect idempotency: 0 duplicate records created after replaying 50 identical reports |
| B7 | FAIL | 0/200 events processed; 200/200 remain QUEUED after worker SIGKILL/restart (no auto-recovery) |

## Top 5 Concerns
1. **A1 (Redis Re-entrant Lock Deadlock)**: Non-zero Redis DB configuration deadlocks indefinitely on `SELECT <db>` due to re-entrant acquisition of `_lock`.
2. **A6 (Unprotected Report Ingestion)**: Zero rate limiting on `POST /api/v1/reports` allows volumetric denial of service and ingestion flooding.
3. **B1 / A10 (Connection Exhaustion via NullPool)**: Backend uses `NullPool` without connection limits, opening 46 connections under 50 users and risking DB saturation.
4. **B5 (1:1 Redis Connection Scaling for SSE)**: Every connected SSE subscriber holds a dedicated Redis TCP connection rather than sharing a pub/sub multiplexer.
5. **B7 / A10 (No Redis Stream PEL Claiming)**: Consumers lack `XAUTOCLAIM` / `XCLAIM`, stranding pending messages when workers crash or restart ungracefully.
