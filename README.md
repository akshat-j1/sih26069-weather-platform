## 1. Project Overview & Mission

The **National Weather Big Data Analytics Platform** is an AI-augmented big data analytics and geospatial intelligence platform engineered to ingest, corroborate, and analyze multi-source meteorological feeds and crowdsourced citizen incident reports during extreme weather emergencies.

The platform bridges the gap between high-altitude meteorological observations (IMD radar, AWS, hydrological stations) and localized ground realities (urban waterlogging, flash floods, landslides, storm damage) through:
- **High-Throughput Multi-Source Ingestion**: Citizen web submissions with photo uploads, IMD automatic weather stations, NDMA SACHET alerts, CWC flood telemetry, Mastodon posts, and GDELT disaster news.
- **Intelligent Pipeline**: Rule-based categorization, spatial-temporal deduplication clustering ($R \le 2.5\text{ km}$, $\Delta T \le 120\text{ min}$), and digital evidence/physical sensor corroboration.
- **Explainable Credibility Scoring**: Deterministic, multi-factor scoring engine ($0.0000$ to $0.9800$) providing transparent driver breakdowns and uncertainty flags.
- **Interactive Geospatial Dashboards**: Live Leaflet GIS map with bounded GeoJSON vector layers (`LIMIT 500`), server-aggregated weather analytics, and priority-ranked triage queues for disaster management authorities (NDRF, SDRF, DEOCs).
- **Transactional Real-Time Streaming & Reactive Corroboration**: Atomic outbox pattern in PostgreSQL, dedicated worker relay, 6 dedicated Redis Streams topics, persistent FastAPI Server-Sent Events (`GET /api/v1/events/stream`), late observation/evidence reactive corroboration, and automatic React Query cache invalidation.

## 3. Core Semantic & Architectural Guarantees

1. **Machine Credibility $\ne$ Human Ground Truth**: `credibility_score` ($0.0000$ to $0.9800$) is an algorithmic machine assessment. `verification_status` (`PENDING`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `VERIFIED`, `REJECTED`, `DUPLICATE`) is the authoritative operational state set by human operators.
2. **Crowd Volume $\ne$ Independent Confirmations**: Duplicate reports are clustered with a single diminishing-returns sub-signal, never summed as independent corroborating proofs.
3. **Stage Execution $\ne$ Domain Corroboration**: Orchestration stage outcomes (`SUCCESS_WITH_RESULTS`) signify that an analysis stage executed and found telemetry, not that the incident was verified.
4. **Zero Client-Side Intelligence Math**: The frontend is a pure presentation consumer and never recalculates credibility, cluster embeddings, or corroboration weights.
5. **No Binary Media in Relational Database**: All images and videos reside in S3/MinIO; only metadata, dimensions, SHA-256 checksums, and signed URIs are stored in PostgreSQL (`report_media`).
6. **Delivery Semantics**: At-least-once stream delivery with bounded frontend deduplication (1,000 items). Relevant processing paths are designed and tested to tolerate duplicate delivery without unverified claims of exactly-once.

## 7. System Limitations & Technical Boundaries

To maintain rigorous scientific and engineering integrity, the platform explicitly acknowledges the following operational boundaries:

1. **IMD Automatic Weather Station Telemetry is Mock-Only**: Station-based meteorological corroboration against India Meteorological Department (IMD) ground stations currently operates through deterministic simulation fixtures. Direct live telemetry ingestion requires MoES/IMD station credentials and API gateway whitelisting that are not publicly provisioned.
2. **Open-Meteo Provides Numerical Model Data, Not Station Sensor Data**: Live physical weather corroboration uses Open-Meteo's historical and forecast APIs, which serve numerical weather prediction model runs (ECMWF, GFS, ERA5 reanalysis). These provide gridded meteorological estimates rather than direct physical sensor measurements from ground stations.
3. **Benchmarks are Synthetic or Agent-Authored**: All performance benchmarks, stress loads, and evaluation datasets (including the 200-incident credibility baseline and the 60-post multilingual classification evaluation) were synthetically generated or curated for verification purposes, not drawn from active emergency operations.
4. **Real-World Predictive Accuracy is Unmeasured**: The statistical accuracy (precision, recall, false-positive/negative rates) of physical weather corroboration, image forensics, and location-mismatch penalties on authentic, uncurated field disaster data has not been empirically measured or clinically validated.
5. **Perceptual Hashing (pHash) Was Evaluated on Synthetic Image Perturbations Only**: Hamming distance thresholds (pHash $\le 10$, dHash $\le 8$) were empirically calibrated against controlled synthetic perturbations (rescaling, Gaussian blur, compression). Resilience against aggressive cross-platform transcoding (WhatsApp image re-compression, social media downsampling) remains to be field-tested on real crowdsourced imagery.
6. **Location-Mismatch Penalty is Disabled by Default**: The `LOCATION_MISMATCH_ENABLED` feature flag defaults to `false` in code and deployment to avoid penalizing legitimate citizen reports until regional geocoding gazetteers, colloquial landmark names, and transliterated district spellings are comprehensively validated.
